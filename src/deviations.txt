Deviations from the Design Document are:

1) The variables which will be written to the sockets for the rest of the players, per frame, include:
 • Velocity of paddle (single coordinate) 
 • Integer specifying special power used [0 for no power, 1 for spin left, 2 for spin right, 3 for invisibility, 4 for extra speed]

2) Once the connection is lost, the player can never reconnect and get the control of the paddle.

3) Special Powers : Code written (Commented); Not tested

4) Network Outage : Code written (Commented); Not tested
